# AWS Services

The BC Gov Public Cloud Accelerator Service Team (aka Cloud Pathfinder)'s purpose is to accelerate Ministry Team's access
 and ability to make effective use of Public Cloud.  Public Cloud in this case means infrastructure owned and operated by 3rd
 party Cloud Service Providers in their own data centres, assigned and secured to BC Governement.

The list of tools below is an overview of the AWS services that Cloud Pathfinder has already reviewed in advance for teams to use when they build their apps.
 Services listed as "Endorsed" have completed a generic privacy and security review and are endorsed for use, making up a developer toolbox of pre-vetted services.
 Each application being built and hosted in the cloud requires a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and Security Threat Risk Assessment (STRA).

Each application engagement is required to kick-off with the Ministry Privacy Officer (MPO) and Ministry Information Security Officer (MISO) present to that they have time
 to work on the PIA and STRA while the team gets started on their app. Most teams usually begin work with a few weeks of DevOps pipeline automation setup,
 so this gives time for the compliance work to happen in parallel. Teams are prohibited from leaving compliance to the last minute prior to big launch dates.  Teams are encouraged to work collaboratively
 releasing frequently to production to avoid last minute delivery issues when tech debt in unused pipelines shows up.

If services other than the Endorsed (pre-vetted) ones listed below are desired, one can either approach the Cloud Pathfinder team to ask them to add a new endorsed
 tool to the services list, or one can have the MPO and MISO on the ministry team include the service in the application STRA and PIA.
 Going through Cloud Pathfinder is recommended as there are rare instances where enabling certain services is challenging due to Secure Environment Accelerator (SEA)-wide guardrails that
 cannot be changed without affecting the compliance of the whole SEA. The purpose of the below list of tools is to save teams time by providing reusable information that can help accelerate their PIA and STRA processes.
